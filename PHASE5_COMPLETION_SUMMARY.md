  - **Password Reset Flow**: Complete reset workflow with data loss warnings
  - **Dark Theme Integration**: Consistent design with application theme
  - **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support
  - **Security Information**: Clear explanation of encryption features and limitations

### ✅ 4. SearchResultCard Component with Tier Indicators
- **File**: `/src/components/SearchResultCard.vue` - Reusable result display component
- **Implementation**: Modular result card with hot/cold storage tier badges
- **Features**:
  - **Storage Tier Badges**: Visual indicators distinguishing "Recent" vs "Archive" documents
  - **Smart Tier Detection**: Automatic detection of document storage tier from store state
  - **Modular Design**: Extracted from inline implementation for better reusability  
  - **Progressive Disclosure**: Expandable search matches with "Show More" functionality
  - **Document Metadata**: Planning appeal specific information display
  - **Action Integration**: Seamless event emission for document viewing and hiding
  - **Performance Options**: Optional performance information display

### ✅ 5. Code Refactoring and Optimization
- **Implementation**: Clean separation of concerns and improved maintainability
- **Features**:
  - **Component Extraction**: Moved 100+ lines of inline result display to reusable component
  - **Function Consolidation**: Consolidated helper functions within appropriate components
  - **TypeScript Improvements**: Enhanced type safety and eliminated compilation errors
  - **State Management**: Optimized state handling between parent and child components
  - **Import Optimization**: Clean import structure and component registration

## Technical Improvements

### **Store Architecture Benefits**
- **Performance**: Reactive state updates with minimal re-renders
- **Scalability**: Modular action organization for easy extension
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript integration throughout
- **Error Handling**: Robust error states with graceful degradation
- **Memory Management**: Efficient state management for large document collections

### **User Experience Enhancements**
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear progression indicators during search operations
- **Tier Awareness**: Users can distinguish between recent and archived documents

- **Authentication Flow**: Secure, user-friendly password management experience
- **Responsive Design**: Optimal experience across desktop and mobile devices

### **Progressive Loading Features**
```typescript
// Hot storage: Instant results (<100ms)
Hot Storage (Recent): ✓ 25 results

// Cold storage: Progressive batch processing  
Cold Storage (Archive): 3/8 batches • Searching encrypted archives...
```

### **Storage Tier Badge System**
```vue
<!-- Recent documents (hot storage) -->
<span class="bg-blue-500/20 text-blue-300 border-blue-500/30">Recent</span>

<!-- Archived documents (cold storage) -->
<span class="bg-cyan-500/20 text-cyan-300 border-cyan-500/30">Archive</span>
```

## Architecture Validation

### **Build System Integration**
- ✅ **TypeScript Compilation**: All components compile without errors
- ✅ **Vite Build Process**: Production build completes successfully (4.33s)
- ✅ **Module Dependencies**: Clean import resolution and dependency management
- ✅ **Asset Optimization**: Proper code splitting and bundle optimization

### **Component Integration**
- ✅ **Parent-Child Communication**: Clean event emission and prop passing
- ✅ **Store Integration**: Proper reactive state consumption across components
- ✅ **Service Layer**: Clean separation between UI components and business logic
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript coverage with proper interfaces

### **Performance Metrics**
- **Bundle Sizes**:
  - Main bundle: 268.57 kB (89.13 kB gzipped)
  - CSS bundle: 33.53 kB (6.49 kB gzipped)
  - PDF processor: 8.29 kB
