This directory contains encrypted document batches for the cold storage tier.

Structure:
- storage-index.json: Index of all encrypted batches
- documents-batch-*.json: Encrypted document batches (AES-GCM-256)

Example batch names:
- documents-batch-001.json
- documents-batch-002.json

All batches are encrypted using AES-GCM-256 with PBKDF2 key derivation (600,000 iterations).
