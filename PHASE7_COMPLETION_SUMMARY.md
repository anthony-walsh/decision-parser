## Technical Architecture

### **Build Configuration Strategy**
```javascript
// Vite configuration highlights
export default defineConfig({
  base: '/decision-parser/',           // GitHub Pages base path
  assetsInclude: ['**/*.wasm'],        // Include WASM files as assets
  worker: { format: 'es' },           // ES module workers
  optimizeDeps: {
    exclude: ['sql.js', 'absurd-sql'] // Exclude problematic dependencies
  },
  build: {
    target: 'esnext',                  // Modern browser support
    rollupOptions: {
      output: {
        manualChunks: {               // Intelligent code splitting
          'sql-wasm': sql.js/absurd-sql bundles,
          'performance-services': memory/performance services,
          'storage-services': storage/encryption services
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

### **Asset Organization**
```
dist/
â”œâ”€â”€ sql-wasm/

â”œâ”€â”€ cold-storage/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ storage-index.json         # Cold storage batch index
â”œâ”€â”€ workers/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ hotStorageWorker-*.js      # Hot storage operations (71KB)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ coldStorageWorker-*.js     # Cold storage operations (12KB)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ migrationWorker-*.js       # Document migration (10KB)

```

### **Security Configuration**
```javascript
// Security headers for production
headers: {
  'Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy': 'require-corp',  // Required for WASM
  'Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy': 'same-origin',     // Required for workers
  'Content-Security-Policy': 'script-src self unsafe-eval wasm-unsafe-eval',
  'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',
  'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY'
}
```

- **Performance Monitoring**: Build validation and size monitoring in place

Phase 7 successfully transforms the application into a production-ready system with comprehensive build configuration, optimized asset management, and deployment readiness for static hosting environments.

## Critical Implementation Notes

### **SQLite WASM Configuration**
- WASM files must be served with proper MIME types (`application/wasm`)
- Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy and Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy headers required
- WASM files should be cached aggressively (1 year) for performance

### **Worker Deployment**
- ES module workers require modern browser support
- Workers must be served from same origin or with proper CORS headers
- Worker chunks should be kept separate for better caching strategies

### **Cold Storage Assets**
- Storage index must be properly formatted JSON with version metadata
- Encrypted batch files should have proper Content-Type headers
- Cache headers should balance freshness with performance

### **Security Considerations**
- CSP headers must allow `unsafe-eval` and `wasm-unsafe-eval` for SQLite
- Worker sources must include `blob:` for dynamic worker creation
- All external resources must be properly validated and secured

This comprehensive build configuration ensures the application is production-ready with optimal performance, security, and deployment characteristics.
