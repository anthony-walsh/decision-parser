## Cold Storage Structure

The system now supports encrypted batch storage with the following structure:

```json
// /public/cold-storage/storage-index.json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "totalDocuments": 0,
  "totalBatches": 0,
  "lastUpdated": "2025-06-26T00:00:00.000Z",
  "batches": [],
  "metadata": {
    "encryptionAlgorithm": "AES-GCM",
    "keyDerivation": "PBKDF2",
    "pbkdf2Iterations": 600000,
    "batchSizeLimit": 15728640,
    "documentThreshold": 1000,
    "created": "2025-06-26T00:00:00.000Z",
    "description": "Cold storage index for encrypted document batches with AES-GCM-256 encryption"
  }
}
```

## Search Integration

The unified search now supports:
- **Hot Storage**: Instant SQLite FTS5 results (<100ms)
- **Cold Storage**: Progressive encrypted batch search (500-2000ms)
- **Parallel Execution**: Both tiers searched simultaneously
- **Progress Updates**: Real-time feedback during cold storage operations
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues with hot-only search if cold storage fails

## Next Steps (Phase 4)

Phase 3 provides the foundation for Phase 4: Document Lifecycle Management. The architecture is now ready for:

1. **Hot-to-Cold Migration**: Automatic document archiving based on age/access patterns
2. **Document Tier Manager**: 5,000 document hot storage limit enforcement
3. **Migration Status UI**: User notifications and progress tracking
4. **Background Processing**: Automated tier management

## Build Status
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ Development server starts successfully  
- ✅ All cold storage integrations working
- ✅ Type safety and error handling implemented

The application now has a complete encrypted cold storage system that provides secure, progressive search across large document archives while maintaining optimal performance and memory usage. This completes the foundation for the hybrid SQLite + encrypted cold storage architecture specified in the migration plan.
